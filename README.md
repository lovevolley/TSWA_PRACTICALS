This repository contains a collection of practicals demonstrating key Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques. The projects include:

Dependency Grammar: Analyzing sentence structures using dependency parsing.
Text Analytics & Processing: Performing various text preprocessing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
Text Normalization: Techniques for standardizing and cleaning text data, such as removing stop words, special characters, and lowercasing.
TF-IDF Models: Implementation of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency model for text vectorization and feature extraction.
Each practical is designed to showcase hands-on applications of fundamental NLP methods, helping to better understand and implement natural language processing tasks.
